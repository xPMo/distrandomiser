* Changelog
** v0.2-alpha
- Added the ~-m~ / ~--maps-only~ option, which will force the default
  ability order (jump > wings > jets), while keeping the maps randomised.
- You can use a string for the seed again.
- No softlock preventation logic (~-a~ / ~--all~) is now noted in the
  ~randomiser.xml~ file (so anybody who's used it by accident or something
  can be told their bug report is invalid :^) )
- The standard logic no longer requires you to have jump to get Friction.
** v0.1.4-alpha
- Seed is now passed in through a command line flag, instead of the interactive
  prompt
- There's also now flags for verbosity and no softlock checking, which previously
  could only be enabled by editing the script.
** v0.1.3-alpha
- Random seeds are now recoverable - they are printed in the script output
  and in the generated playlist file.
** v0.1.2-alpha
- Destination Unknown and Credits are now included in the playlist
  (you do not need the .bytes, though - they are always added at the end
  unmodified)
** v0.1.1-alpha
- Fixed generated levels having ID conflicts that would prevent them 
  from loading.
- Added a --verison flag.
** v0.1-alpha
- Initial release
